## üé® Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

Staffinc HRMS organizes its codebase around specific business domains using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. Each module, such as hooks, interfaces, services, etc., is grouped within the `src/modules/<domain>` folder. This structure enhances code readability, maintainability, and scalability by aligning code with business concepts and requirements.

For more information on Domain-Driven Design, refer to the [official DDD website](https://dddcommunity.org/).

## üíª Code Standar

### Component

#### ‚ùï Component type

Always create a type definition for a component above the component, irrespective of whether the type will be used in another place or not. Follow this naming convention: `<ComponentName>Props`

#### ‚ùïMantine Library utilization

We use mantine to construct UI easier, but since we are trying to make this repositroy pug and play. We also need some custom component extending the capability of mantine and also since some of mantine UI does not have capability that we need (eg: Group doesn't have capability to be responsive) hence we create a custom component. Some components that we created by our own:

1. **Layout related**: HStack, VStack, Row, Col
2. **Input related**: TextInput, PasswordInput, Switch
3. **Typography related**:

This Docs will be frequently update based on the update of the codebase since we might create new component during development.

In the `/shared/components` if you found a folder starting with lowercase, it means the components is a component that commonly used and it is extending from component library, such as HStack, VStack, Button, Grid etc. But if you found a folder/file starting with uppercase like `BasicAppLayout` it means it doesn't wrapping/extending capability from component library

---

### Form

We utilize `react-hook-form` library for form usage, but we wrap the library within `useFormAdapter`, again.. we want to expose only the API we need, and in case something bad happen with the library. We just need to change it in one place

---

### Datatable

To enhance the clarity of the Datatable component, separate the initiation of columns and data fetching from the component. It is preferable to create a `use<domain>Datatable`, for example, `useRoleDatatable`.

Within the file, you can fetch the datatable data, set up parameters, or handle pagination. This ensures that the main responsibility of rendering the datatable is not overly complex. Here is an example of `useRoleDatatable`:

<details>
    <summary>
        useRoleDatatable example
    </summary>
    
```ts
export const useRoleDatatable = () => {
    const { data, isFetching: fetching } = useRoleQuery({
        params: { limit: 20, skip: 0 },
        queryOpts: { refetchOnWindowFocus: false },
    });

    const columns: DataTableColumn<Role>[] = useMemo(
        () => [
            {
                accessor: 'name',
                title: 'Role Name',
            },
            { accessor: 'num_accounts', title: 'Account' },
            {
                accessor: 'is_all_access',
                title: 'Access',
                render: ({ is_all_access }: Role) => {
                    return is_all_access ? 'All access' : 'Limited access';
                },
            },
        ],
        [],
    );

    return useMemo(
        () => ({
            columns,
            records: data?.data,
            totalRecords: data?.total,
            fetching,
        }),
        [columns, data, fetching],
    );

};
